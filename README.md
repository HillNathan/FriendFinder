# FriendFinder
Friend Finder is a basic Express server app using a simple survey to match up people based on their preference of Marvel superheroes. The user rates ten Marvel heroes from 1-5. The app then searches the list of users for other users that scores the heroes similarly. The total rating with the least difference will be displayed for the user. 

The app has a list of three friends to seed the application in the friends.js file, and if the server were to restart the data would not persist.
